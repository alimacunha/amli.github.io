## Brazil to US Export Analysis 2024 — Power BI 
A data-driven analysis of Brazil's 2024 exports to the U.S., visualized using Power BI, in light of new tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, set to take effect in August 2025. These tariffs, targeting Brazilian goods, could affect a trade flow worth nearly $40 billion.

![Brazil to US Export Analysis](Images/ExportsUS.jpg)

Key findings show that nearly half of exports come from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro—driven by Embraer aircraft and crude oil, respectively. While the U.S. plans a 50% tariff on many imports, almost half of Brazilian exports—including aircraft, oil, and orange juice—will remain at a 10% rate. However, coffee and meat will face steeper increases.
